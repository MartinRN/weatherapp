# WeatherApp

## Presentation

Feel free to visit [this url](http://pacific-ridge-83881.herokuapp.com) to test it.
This is a simple weather app that use OpenWeatherMap API and the Symfony framework.
It keeps me coding when I have time.

## Next features
I would like to add:
  * Autocompletion for the city
  * Be able to select the country
  * A color code based on the weather
  * A map showing the position of the city
